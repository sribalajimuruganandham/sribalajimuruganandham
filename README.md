# Hey there, I'm Sri Balaji! 👋

## Fun Fact 🤓  
If you ever debugged something in production with a coffee in one hand and hope in the other — my friend, we speak the same language ☕👨‍💻  
And if something’s missing on GitHub? Lost in battle with version control, it may be. Forgotten to push, I might have. Patience, young dev. The commit will come.
